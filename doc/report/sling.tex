\begin{abstract}
This paper describes SLING, which is a framework for building
parsers for annotating text with semantic frames.
The parser is a general transition-based frame semantic parser that uses
bi-directional LSTMs for input encoding and a Transition Based Recurrent
Unit (TBRU) for output decoding.
It is a jointly trained model using only the text tokens as input and the
transition system has been designed to output frame graphs directly without
any intervening symbolic representation.
The SLING framework includes an efficient and scalable frame store
implementation as well as a neural network JIT compiler for fast parsing at
runtime.
The SLING framework is implemented in C++ and it is available for download
on GitHub.

\section{Introduction}

Recent advances in machines learning have enabled the use of deep learning to
train recurrent multi-level neural network classifiers. This has allowed us to
reconsider how to best design and implement systems for natural language
understanding (NLU).

Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) systems have used a cascade of
NLP modules for syntatic and semantic annotation of text.
These systems typically first do part-of-speech (POS) tagging, followed by
constituency or dependency parsing for syntactic analysis.
Using the POS tags and parse trees as feature inputs, one could then do other
NLP tasks like mention chunking, entity type tagging, coreference resolution,
semantic role labeling (SRL), etc.

Pipelined systems often use a simple 1-best feed forward strategy \cite{finkel2006}
where they greedily take the best output of each stage and pass it on to the
next stage.
While it is simple to build such an architecture, errors can accumulate
throughout the pipeline making it much harder for the system to perform
correctly, e.g. F1 on SRL drops by more than 10\% when going from gold to
automatic parse trees \cite{toutanova2005}.

Often, applications do not need the intermediate annotations produced
by the lower levels in the NLP stack, so it would be preferable if these systems
could be trained jointly to optimize an objective based on the output
annotations needed for a particular application.

Classic NLP systems are also often trained using linear classifiers.
Because of the simplicity of these, very complex and elaborate feature
extraction with many different types of features as well as many kinds
of combinations of these features are often required for good accuracy.
With deep learning one can use embeddings, multiple layers, and recurrent
network connections instead, and this often removes the need for complex
feature design. The internal learned representations in the hidden layers of
the models can be used instead of the hand-crafted intermediate representations
in pipelined systems.


We present the SLING parser that leverages deep learning to bypass the some of
the limitations of classic pipelined systems.
It is a transition-based parser that outputs frame graphs directly without any
intervening symbolic representation (see Section~\ref{sec:ts}). Transition-based
parsing is often associated with dependency parsing, but we have designed a
specialized transition system that outputs frame graphs instead of dependency
trees.

We use a recurrent feed-forward unit for predicting the actions in the
transition sequence, where the hidden activations from predicting each
transition step are fed back into the subsequent steps.
A bidirectional LSTM is used for encoding the input, where we have both a
left-to-right and a right-to-left LSTM, see Figure~\ref{fig:network}.
This neural network architecture has been implemented using DRAGNN \cite{dragnn}
and Tensorflow \cite{tensorflow}.

We have made the SLING parsing framework available as open source and the code
for the parser described in this paper can be found on GitHub.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/google/sling}}

In Section~\ref{sec:framesem} we introduce \emph{frame semantics}, which is the
underlying linguistic theory, as well as the SLING frame store, which is our
C++ framework for representing and storing semantic frames compactly and
efficiently.
Section \ref{sec:att} introduces our attention mechanism and
Section~\ref{sec:ts} describes the transition system used for producing the
frame graphs. Section~\ref{sec:features} describes the features used by the
parser.

  for constructing the input feature vector for the next step. The FF unit is
  run repeatedly until the transition system has reached a terminal state.}

\section{Frame semantics}
\label{sec:framesem}

While frames in SLING are not tied to any particular frame semantic theory or
knowledge ontology, they are inspired by \emph{frame semantics}, which is a
theory of linguistic meaning developed by Charles Fillmore \cite{fillmore1982}.
Frame semantics connects linguistic semantics to encyclopedic knowledge and the
central idea is that understanding the meaning of a word requires access to all
the essential knowledge that relates to that word. A word \emph{evokes} a frame
representing the specific concept it refers to.

A semantic frame is a set of facts that specify "characteristic
features, attributes, and functions of a denotatum, and its characteristic
interactions with things necessarily or typically associated with it." \cite{alan2001}.
A semantic frame can also be vieved as a coherent structure of related concepts
that are related such that knowledge of all of them is required to have
complete knowledge of any one.

Frame semantics is not only for individual concepts, but can be generalized
to phrases, entities, constructions, and other larger and more complex linguistic
and ontological units. Semantic frames can be also used in information modeling
for constructing knowledge bases of world knowledge and common sense, and frame
semantics can also form the basis for reasoning about metaphors, metonymy,
actions, perspective, etc.

\section{Frame in SLING}
\label{sec:slingframes}

At a more technical level, a SLING frame consists of a list of slots, where each
slot has a name (role) and a value. The slot values can be literals like numbers
and strings, or links to other frames. The frames essentially form a graph where
the frames are the (typed) nodes and the slots are the labeled edges. A frame
graph can also be viewed as a feature structure \cite{carpenter2005} and
unification can be used for induction of new frames from existing frames.
Sometimes it is also useful to use frames for representing more basic data
structures like a C struct with fields, a JSON object, or a record in a
database.

SLING frames live inside a \emph{frame store}. A store is a container that
tracks the all the frames that have been allocated in the store, and serves as a
memory allocation arena for the allocated frames. When making a new frame, one
specifies the store that the frame should be allocated in. The frame will live in
this store until the store is deleted or the frame is garbage collected because
there are more no references to it.\footnote{See the \href{https://github.com/google/sling/blob/master/frame/README.md}{SLING Guide}
for a detailed description of the SLING frame store implementation.}

The SLING text format is a superset of JSON that allows you to have references
between frames (i.e. JSON objects) using the {\tt \#n} syntax. The frames can be
assigned ids using the {\tt=\#n} syntax. SLING frames can have both numeric and
named ids and both slot names and values can be frame references. Where JSON
objects can only represent trees, SLING frames can be used for representing
arbitrary graphs. SLING has special syntax for built-in slot names:

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Syntax & Symbol & RDF \\
\hline
=name & id:name & rdf:ID \\
:name & isa:name & rdf:InstanceOf \\
+name & is:name & rdfs:subClassOf \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Documents are also represented using frames, where the document frame has slots
for the document text, the tokens, and the mention phrases and the frames they
evoke. See Figure~\ref{fig:slingdoc} for an example.

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \begin{verbatim}
{
  :/s/document
  /s/document/text: "John hit the ball"
  /s/document/tokens: [
    {/s/token/text: "John" /s/token/start: 0  /s/token/length: 4},
    {/s/token/text: "hit"  /s/token/start: 5  /s/token/length: 3},
    {/s/token/text: "the"  /s/token/start: 9  /s/token/length: 3},

    /s/phrase/evokes: {=#2 :/s/consumer_good }
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{The text ``John hit the ball" in SLING frame notation. The document
  itself is represented by a frame that has the text, an array of tokens and

  a consumer good frame (bat) and a hit-01 frame. The hit frame has the person
  frame as the agent (arg0) and the ball frame as the object (arg1).}

\section{Attention}
\label{sec:att}

The SLING parser is essentially a sequence-to-sequence model where the LSTM
encoder takes the input text and produces an internal representation of the
stimuli, i.e. the input text.
The decoder then takes this internal representation and uses a transition-based
feed-forward unit to predict the sequence of actions for updating the transition
system state (Figure~\ref{fig:network}).

Sequence-to-sequence models often use an ``attention" mechanism to focus
the decoder on the important parts of the input for producing the next output
symbol. In this model, ``attention" refers to focusing on certain parts of the
input as relevant for producing the next output.

We use a somewhat different notion of \emph{attention} that is closer to
recent neuroscience research on attention and awareness in the brain
\cite{nelson2017} and \cite{graziano2013}.
Our attention model is expressed in terms of the semantic frames inferred from
the text so far.
This is different from neural attention in sequence-to-sequence models
since we model attention in terms of semantic frames evoked from the text rather
than (encodings of) the text itself.

As part of the transition system state, we maintain an \emph{attention buffer}.
This is a prioritized list of semantic frames where the frames that are closest
to the center of attention is at the front of the list. The transition actions
maintains the attention buffer and moves frames to the front whenever a frame
is evoked or re-evoked by the input text. When a new frame is evoked, it will
merge the concept and its roles into a new coherent chunk of meaning, which is
represented by the new frame and it relations to other frames, and this will
become the new center of attention. The hypothesis is that by maintaining this
attention mechanism, we only need to look at a few recent frames brought into
attention in order to build up the desired frame graph.

\section{Transition system}
\label{sec:ts}

In the parsing literature, \emph{transition systems} have been
used to construct dependency parse trees from a sequence of state-action pairs
$(s_i,a_i)$. A transition system takes a state $s_i$ and an action $a_i$ and
constructs a new state $s_{i+1}$. This allows you to build a tree structure by
predicting a sequence of actions. For example, the \emph{arc-standard}
transition system \cite{nivre2006} uses {\bf SHIFT}, {\bf LEFT-ARC(label)}, and
{\bf RIGHT-ARC(label)} actions to construct a dependency parse tree from a
sequence of these actions.

We are using the same core idea to construct a frame graph where frames can be
evoked by phrases in the input. Instead of using a stack, we have an
\emph{attention buffer}, which keeps track of the most salient frames in the
discourse. The front of the attention buffer serves as the short-term memory of
the parser and the parser actions operate on these frames. The actions in the
transition system both builds up the frame graph as well as maintains the
attention buffer. The transition system consists of the following actions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf SHIFT} -- Moves to next input token. Only valid when not at the
        end of the input buffer.
  \item {\bf STOP} -- Signals that we have reach the end of the parse. This is
        only valid when at the end of the input buffer. Multiple STOP actions
        can be added to the transition sequence, e.g. to make all sequences in a
        beam have the same length. After a STOP is issued, no other actions are
        permitted except more STOP actions.
  \item {\bf EVOKE(type, n)} -- Evokes frame of with type {\bf type} from
        the next {\bf n} tokens in the input. The evoked frame becomes the new
        center of attention.
  \item {\bf REFER(frame, n)} -- Makes a new mention of the next {\bf n} tokens
        in the input evoking an existing frame in the attention buffer. This
        frame will become the new center of attention.
  \item {\bf CONNECT(source, role, target)} -- Adds slot to {\bf source} frame
        in the attention buffer with name {\bf role} and value {\bf target}
        where {\bf target} is an existing frame in the attention buffer. The
        {\bf source} frame become the new center of attention.
  \item {\bf ASSIGN(frame, role, value)} -- Adds slot to {\bf source} frame in
        the attention buffer  with name {\bf role} and value {\bf value} and
        moves the frame to the center of attention.
  \item {\bf EMBED(target, role, type)} -- Creates a new frame with
        type {\bf type} and add a slot to it with name {\bf role} and value
        {\bf target} where {\bf target} is an existing frame in the attention
        buffer. The new frame becomes the new center of attention.
  \item {\bf ELABORATE(source, role, type)} -- Creates a new frame with type
        {\bf type} and adds a slot to an existing frame {\bf source} in the
        attention buffer with {\bf role} set to the new frame. The new frame
        becomes the new center of attention.
\end{itemize}

In summary, {\bf EVOKE} and {\bf REFER} are used to evoke frames from text
mentions, while {\bf ELABORATE} and {\bf EMBED} are used to create frames not
directly evoked by text.

This transition system can generate any connected frame graph where the frames
are either directly on indirectly evoked by mention phrases in the text. A frame
can be evoked by multiple mentions and the graph can have cycles.

The transition system can potentially have an unbounded number of actions since
it is parameterized by phrase length and attention buffer indices with can be
arbitrarily large, so in the current implementation, we only consider the
top $k$ frames in the attention buffer $(k=5)$ and do not consider phrases
longer than those in the training copus.

Multiple transition sequences can generate the same frame annotations, but we
have implemented an oracle sequence generator that takes a document and converts
it to a canonical transition sequence in a way similar to how this is done
for transition-based dependency parsing \cite{nivre2006}, e.g. the sentence
``John hit the ball" will generate the following transition sequence:
\begin{verbatim}
  EVOKE(/s/person, 1)
  SHIFT
  EVOKE(/s/hit-01, 1)
  CONNECT(0, /pb/arg0, 1)
  SHIFT
  SHIFT
  EVOKE(/s/consumer_good, 1)
  CONNECT(1, /pb/arg1, 0)
  SHIFT
  STOP
\end{verbatim}

\section{Features}
\label{sec:features}

The LSTMs only uses lexical features based on the current input word:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The current word itself. During training we initialize the embeddings
  for this feature with pre-trained word embeddings \cite{mikolov2013} for all
  the words in the vocabulary collected from the training data.
  \item The prefixes and suffixes of the current input word. We only use
  prefixes up to three characters in our experiments.
  \item Word shape features based on the characters in the current input word:
  hyphenation, capitalization, punctuation, quotes, and digits. Each of these
  features has its own embedding matrix.
\end{itemize}

The TBRU is a simple feed-forward unit with a single hidden layer.
It takes the hidden activations from the LSTMs as well as the activations from
the hidden layer from the previous steps as raw input features, and maps them
through embedding matrices to get the input vector for the  hidden layer. The
raw input features used are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The hidden activations from the left-to-right and right-to-left LSTMs
  for the current token in the parser state.
  \item The attention feature looks at the top-5 frames in the attention buffer
  and finds the phrases in the text (if any) that evoked them. The activations
  from the left-to-right and right-to-left LSTMs for the last token in these
  phrases are used as input features. These serve as the continuous lexical
  representations of the top frames in the attention buffer.
  \item The hidden layer activations of the transition steps which evoked or
  brought into focus the top-5 frames in the attention buffer. These serves as a
  continuous representation of the semantic context for these frames, i.e. a
  representation of the state when these frames were evoked most recently.
  \item The history feature uses the hidden activations in the feed-forward
  unit from the previous five steps as feature inputs to the current step.
  \item The roles features extract the role edges between the top-5 frames in
  the attention buffer. These are triples of the form $(s_i, r_i, t_i)$ meaning
  that the frame at position $s_i$ in the attention buffer has a role $r_i$ with
  the frame at position $t_i$ in the attention buffer as its value. Back-off
  features are added for the source roles $(s_i,r_i)$, target role $(r_i, t_i)$,
  and unlabeled roles $(s_i,t_i)$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments}

We have used the OntoNotes corpus \cite{ontonotes2006} to construct a corpus
with frame semantic annotations for evaluation the parser. We have taken the
PropBank SRL layer \cite{palmer2005} and converted the predicate-argument
structures into frame annotations. We have also annotated the corpus with
entity mentions with entity types using a state-of-the-art entity tagger.
We have determined the head token of each argument span and if this coincides
with an entity mention, we have used this as the evoking span for the argument
frame, otherwise we have just used the head token.

\section{Evaluation}

An annotated document consists of a number of connected frames and as well as
phrases, i.e. token spans, evoking these frames. We evaluate the accuracy of the
annotations by comparing the generated frames with the gold standard frame
annotations from the evaluation corpus.

The documents are matched by constructing a virtual graph where the document
is the start node. The document node is then connected to the spans and the
spans are connected to the frames that the spans evoke. This graph is then
extended by following the frame-to-frame links from the roles. Accuracy is
computed by aligning the golden and predicted graphs and computing precision,
recall, and F1. The accuracy is computed for spans, frames, types, roles, and
labels.

network.
