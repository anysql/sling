# SLING - A natural language frame semantics parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/sling.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/sling)

SLING is a parser for annotating text with frame semantic annotations. It is a
general transition-based frame semantic parser using bi-directional LSTMs for
input encoding and a Transition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU) for output decoding.
It is a jointly trained model using only the text tokens as input and the
transition system has been designed to output frame graphs directly without any
intervening symbolic representation.

The SLING framework includes an efficient and scalable frame store
implementation as well as a neural network JIT compiler for fast parsing at
runtime.

A more detailed description of the SLING parser can be found in this paper:
