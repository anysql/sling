The BUILD rules in this folder use soft-links to add SyntaxNet and Tensorflow code to our include path.
This is because Bazel doesn't directly work with include paths external to the current repo (at least I can't get it to work), thus necessitating the use of soft-links.

However soft-links can't be checked into Github, so you must create the following soft-links before you can use these BUILD rules.

Say your SyntaxNet repo clone is at:
SYN=/path/to/models/syntaxnet
and your Tensorflow includes are at
TF_INC=/path/to/tensorflow/include
(this is typically /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/include/).

Then the soft-links can be created via:

ln -s -T $SYN include1
ln -s -T $SYN/bazel-genfiles include2
ln -s -T $TF_INC include3
